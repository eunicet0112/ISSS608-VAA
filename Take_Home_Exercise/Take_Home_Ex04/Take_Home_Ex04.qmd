## 1.0 Overview

Prototyping plays a pivotal role in the development of applications, serving as a foundation step that can significantly impact the success of the final product. By creating prototypes, we can visualise and refine our ideas, and identify potential flaws early. Prototyping can thus help mitigate risks, save time and resources and ensure that the final application aligns with the intended goals and requirements.

In this exercise, we will be developing the prototype for our Visual Analytics Shiny Application on Singapore's climate. Specifically, we will be focusing on the prototype for the **Historical Analysis** module. This module seeks to visualise Singapore's historical climate data (including rainfall, temperature and wind speed) through two tabs - Overview and Geographical.

## 2.0 Importing Relevant R Packages

The relevant R packages to be used are as follows:

-   dplyr - for manipulating data

-   tidyverse - for tidying data

-   ggplot2 - for creating plots from data

-   plotly - for introducing interactivity into ggplot2 figures

```{r}
pacman::p_load(dplyr, tidyverse, fuzzyjoin,
               ggplot2, plotly, tmap, leaflet, RColorBrewer, htmltools, gganimate, gifski)
```

## 3.0 Data Preparation

### 3.1 Importing Data

Historical daily weather data was retrieved from the [Meteological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/). It consists of data from January 2014 to December 2023 across 12 weather stations. The time period and weather stations were chosen to ensure completeness of the data across all attributes by referencing the [station records](http://www.weather.gov.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Station_Records.pdf) provided by MSS.

The code chunk below downloads the weather data files for the chosen weather stations (`S` values) and time (`yyyymm` values) by fitting the two values into the base URL of 'http://www.weather.gov.sg/files/dailydata/DAILYDATA\_'. The `tryCatch()` function is used to handle errors that may occur during the download process. Specifically, if the file for certain combinations of weather stations and year is not found, it prints a message indicating that the file was not found and continues to the next file.

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "Code to scrape data from chosen weather stations from Jan 2014 to Dec 2023"
#| eval: FALSE
# Define the base URL
base_url <- "http://www.weather.gov.sg/files/dailydata/DAILYDATA_"

# Define the range of S values (weather stations)
s_values <- c("S24", "S50", "S60", "S107", "S111", "S116", "S121", "S43", "S109",
              "S104", "S106", "S107", "S115", "S117")  

# Define the range of yyyymm values (from 201401 to 202312)
yyyymm_values <- c("201401", "201402", "201403", "201404", "201405", "201406", "201407", 
                   "201408", "201409", "201410", "201411", "201412",

                   "201708", "201709", "201710", "201711", "201712",
                   "201801", "201802", "201803", "201804", "201805", "201806", "201807", 
                   "201808", "201809", "201810", "201811", "201812",
                   "201901", "201902", "201903", "201904", "201905", "201906", "201907", 
                   "201908", "201909", "201910", "201911", "201912",
                   "202001", "202002", "202003", "202004", "202005", "202006", "202007", 
                   "202008", "202009", "202010", "202011", "202012",
                   "202101", "202102", "202103", "202104", "202105", "202106", "202107", 
                   "202108", "202109", "202110", "202111", "202112",
                   "202201", "202202", "202203", "202204", "202205", "202206", "202207", 
                   "202208", "202209", "202210", "202211", "202212",
                   "202301", "202302", "202303", "202304", "202305", "202306", "202307", 
                   "202308", "202309", "202310", "202311", "202312") 

# Specify the folder to save the files
folder <- "Data/"

# Loop through each combination of s and yyyymm
for (s in s_values) {
  for (yyyymm in yyyymm_values) {
    # Construct the URL
    url <- paste0(base_url, s, "_", yyyymm, ".csv")
    
    # Construct the file name with folder path
    filename <- paste0(folder, "DAILYDATA_", s, "_", yyyymm, ".csv")
    
    # Download the file with error handling
    tryCatch({
      download.file(url, destfile = filename, mode = "wb")
      cat("Downloaded", filename, "\n")
    }, error = function(e) {
      cat("File not found:", filename, "\n")
    })
  }
}
```

The code chunk below reads all the CSV files saved in the previous step and combines them into a single data frame `df`. The resultant dataframe was saved as an .rds file format using `write_rds()`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "Code to combine datasets into one"
#| eval: FALSE
# Get list of files in the directory
file_list <- list.files("Data/WeatherData", pattern=".csv", full.names = TRUE)

# Initialize an empty list to store preprocessed data frames
preprocessed_data_frames <- list()

# Loop through each file
for (file in file_list) {
  # Read the file and remove header row
  data <- read_csv(file, locale(encoding="UTF-8"), show_col_types = FALSE)[-1, ]
  
  # Replace "\x97" (special character to indicate no measurements done) with NA 
  data <- data.frame(lapply(data, function(x) str_replace_all(x, fixed("\x97"), NA)))

  # Replace "ó" (special character to indicate no measurements done) with NA 
  data <- data.frame(lapply(data, function(x) str_replace_all(x, fixed("ó"), NA)))
  
  # Replace "-" (special character to indicate no measurements done) with NA 
  data <- data.frame(lapply(data, function(x) str_replace_all(x, fixed("-"), NA)))
  
  # Store the preprocessed data frame in the list
  preprocessed_data_frames[[length(preprocessed_data_frames) + 1]] <- data
}

# Ensure all data frames have the same column names and order
combined_df <- do.call(rbind, preprocessed_data_frames)

# Naming columns
colnames(combined_df) <- c("Station", "Year", "Month", "Day", "Total Daily Rainfall", "Highest 30 Min Rainfall", "Highest 60 Min Rainfall", "Highest 120 Min Rainfall", "Mean Temperature", "Maximum Temperature", "Minimum Temperature", "Mean Wind Speed", "Max Wind Speed")

# Save combined_df as .rds file format
write_rds(combined_df, "Data/combined_df.rds")
```

The `read_rds()` function was then used to read the R object.

```{r}
df<- read_rds("Data/combined_df.rds")
```

### 3.2 Data Cleaning

The following data cleaning steps were implemented on the data:

-   **Handling Missing Values**: Using `complete.cases()` to check the rows with complete data, there are 2599 rows with NA values. Since our data has over 47,000 records and incomplete rows form only about 5% of the data, we will drop the rows with NA values for simplicity.

-   **Dealing with Duplicates**: `combined_df[duplicated(combined_df), ]` returned a data frame with zero rows, indicating that there are no duplicate rows. No further action was thus needed.

-   **Data Type Conversion**: All columns are of character type. All columns except the 'Station' column was converted to its appropriate data type using `as.numeric()`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "Code to clean data"

# Checking for NA records and dropping rows with NA records
cat('There are ', sum(!complete.cases(df)), 'rows with NA values')
df <- na.omit(df)

# Checking for duplicate records
# df[duplicated(df), ]

# Converting all columns to numeric form except first
df[, -1] <- lapply(df[, -1], as.numeric)
```

## 4.0 Data Visualisation

For simplicity, we will use **yearly intervals**, **all regions** and **the whole period from 2014 to 2023** for this section. The parameters of this visualisation to allow users to explore the data and customise the visualisation will be discussed later in Section 5.1.

### 4.1 Overview of Historical Daily Weather Data

In this section, we will be developing the prototype for an overview of the historical daily weather data.

```{r}
#| code-fold: TRUE
#| code-summary: "Code to process data for plotting"

# Selecting relevant columns
df1 <- df[, c(2:5, 9:11)] %>%
  
  # Aggregating data using yearly intervals
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(`Mean Temperature`), 
            mean_maxtemp = mean(`Maximum Temperature`), 
            mean_mintemp = mean(`Minimum Temperature`), 
            mean_rainfall = mean(`Total Daily Rainfall`))
```

::: callout-note
## Design Considerations

-   **Colour Differentiation**: Distinct colours were used for the bars and lines to differentiate between the various rainfall and temperature data for greater clarity.

-   **Visual Hierachy**: More critical data points (temperature in this case) were emphasised by placing the temperature line plots above the rainfall bar charts. This helps viewers focus on the primary temperature information while still being able to interpret the secondary rainfall data.

-   **Axis Labels and Units**: The x-axis and y-axis were clearly labelled with its corresponding units to facilitate understanding.

-   **Gridlines and Ticks**: Vertical gridlines were retained to aid in interpretation and aligning data points. However, horizontal grid lines were removed as it clutters the chart and do not add significant value since the bars and line markers clearly denote the year to which the data point belong.

-   **Legend**: A legend was included to explain the meaning of each element in the chart.

As we only have data for 12 weather stations, the significant portion of grey polygons on the map are due to the missing weather data for the respective weather stations. The data was limited to ensure that the plots could be developed quickly. When the Shiny application is developed, we would expected to have a more complete data of more than 60 weather stations to have a more comprehensive map.

## 5.0 User-Interface (UI) Design of Shiny Application

In this module of the application, the user is able to select the weather data from their preferred weather station(s) to analyse and compare the various time series timeline they are interested in. Through this, the user is able to understand the historical trends and average of temperature and/or rainfall data during the selected time period.

### 5.1 Storyboard of Shiny Application

![](images/Screenshot%202024-03-08%20at%206.34.06%20PM.png)

### 5.2 User-Specified Parameters of Shiny Application

The figure below shows some of the interactive features of the application. The main objective is to allow users to have an overview of the historical data of their selection weather station(s) and time period.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-03-08%20at%206.35.32%20PM.png)

The parameters users can specify include the following:

-   **Averaging Period**: Users can choose the averaging period they prefer, including monthly, 1-year, 5-years or 10-years, using the drop-down list.

-   **Period for Analysis**: Users can choose the start and end date they prefer, from January 1980 to current using the slider. However, limited data is available from January 1980 to December 2013 and may cause the plots to be incomplete.

-   **Weather Station(s)**: Users can choose their preferred weather station(s) by checking the checkboxes of weather stations they are interested in. A checkbox for "All weather stations" will be included for convenience.

-   **Update Data**: Users can choose to update the data to include the most current data points available on the MSS website. The application is built using data up till December 2023. Users may be interested in analysing more current weather data and can include such points using the "Update Data" button to scrape the data from the MSS website.

-   **Selection of Map Type**: Users can choose to display temperature or rainfall data on the map using the radio buttons available. Users can also choose the type of data to be displayed, such as mean, maximum or minimum, using the drop-down list.

-   **Selection of Plot**: Users can choose the data points they wish to display on the plot by toggling through the legend of the plot.
